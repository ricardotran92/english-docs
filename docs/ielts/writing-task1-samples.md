> The first graph shows that there is a gradual decrease in study for career reasons with age. Nearly 80% of students under 26 years, study for their career. This percentage gradually declines by 10-20% every decade. Only 40% of 40-49yr olds and 18% of over 49yr olds studing for career reasons in late adulthood.
>
> Conversely, the first graph also shows that study stemming from interest increases with age. There are only 10% of under 26yr olds studing out of interest. The percentage increases slowly till the beginning of the fourth decade, and increases dramatically in late adulthood. Nearly same number of 40-49yr olds study for career and interest. However 70% of over 49yr olds study for interest in comparison to 18% studing for career reasons in that age group.
>
> The second graph shows that employer support is maximum (approximately 60%) for the under 26yr students. It drops rapidly to 32% up to the third decade of life, and then increses in late adulthood up to about 44%. It is unclear whether employer support is only for career-focused study, but the highest level is for those students who mainly study for career purposes.

> *model answer:*
>
> The graph shows how the amount of water used worldwide changed between 1900 and 2000.
>
> Throughout the century, the largest quantity of water was used for agricultural Purposes, and this increased dramatically from about 500 km³ to around 3,000 km³ in the year 2000. Water used in the industrial and domestic sectors also increased, but consumption was minimal until mid-century. From 1950 onwards, industrial use grew steadily to just over 1,000 km³, while domestic use rose more slowly to only 300 km³, both far below the levels of consumption by agriculture.
>
> The table illustrates the differences in agriculture consumption in some areas of the world by contrasting the amount of irrigated land in Brazil (26,500 km³) with that in the D.R.C. (100 km²). This means that a huge amount of water is used in agriculture in Brazil, and this is reflected in the figures for water consumption per person: 359 m³ compared with only 8 m³ in the Congo. With a population of 176 million, the figures for Brazil indicate how high agriculture water consumption can be in some countries.

In addition, the second most popular activity, attracting 80% of boys and 60% of girls, was playing electronic or computer games. While girls rated activities such as art and craft highly – just under 60% stated that they enjoyed these in their spare time – only 35% of boys opted for creative pastimes. Bike riding, on the other hand, was almost as popular as electronic games amongst boys and, perhaps surprisingly, almost 60% of girls said that they enjoyed this too. Skateboarding was relatively less popular amongst both boys and girls, although it still attracted 35% of boys and 25% of girls.

>
> The Hawaiian island chain, in the centre of the Pacific Ocean, is approximately 2,700 km in length. It is formed of volcanoes and the active ones are at the south-east tip of the archipelago, where Hawaii itself is located.
>
> It is believed that the chain began to form nearly 80 million years ago. Each island started to evolve after an eruption on the sea floor. First, a \`hot spot' existed on the ocean bed, which let out a plume of material called magma. This magma may originate as deep as 2,883km below the ocean bed. Next, further eruptions took place, which built up the volcano. Eventually, it emerged above the surface of the ocean.
>
> Since that time, the spume of magma has remained static as the Pacific tectonic plate moves in a north-west direction across it at a speed of 7-9cm per year. As it moves, a volcano forms as it passes over the hotspot and then become inactive when it has passed it.

Paris is the second oldest, in which it was opened in the year 1900. This was then followed by the opening of the railway systems in Tokyo, Washington DC and Kyoto. Los Angeles has the newest underground railway system, and was only opened in the year 2001. In terms of the size of the railway systems, London, For certain, has the largest underground railway systems. It has 394 kilometres of route in total, which is nearly twice as large as the system in Paris. Kyoto, in contrast, has the smallest system. It only has 11 kilometres of route, which is more than 30 times less than that of London.

> Over the past 30 years, the average family has dramatically increased the number of meals that they eat at restaurants. The percentage of the family's food budget spent on restaurant meals steadily climbed. Just 10 percent of the food budget was spent on restaurant meals in 1970, and 15 percent in 1980. That percentage more than doubled in 1990, to 35 percent, and rose again in 2000 to 50 percent.

> Where families eat their restaurant meals also changed during that 30-year period. In 1970, families ate the same number of meals at fast food and sit-down restaurants. In 1980, fam¬ilies ate slightly more frequently at sit-down restaurants. However, since 1990, fast food restaurants serve more meals to the families than do the sit-down restaurants. Most of the restaurant meals from 2000 were eaten at fast food restaurants. If this pattern continues, eventually the number of meals that families eat at fast food restaurants could double the number of meals they eat at sit-down restaurants.

> In Figure 1 it can be seen that the flu was responsible for the deaths of 2 females but no males in the period from March to May. However, from June to August, there were 4 female deaths and 1 male death.
>
> According to the pie chart in Figure 2, only those females most at risk were given the new flu vaccine; 28% did not take part in the trial. Of those females who took part, 35% were aged (over 65 years old); 24% were babies or children; and 13% were either hospitalised or receiving other medical attention.
>
> From Figure 3 it is clear that the new vaccine had a positive effect on the number of new cases of flu reported in females. There were just over 1000 cases reported in March, climbing rapidly to a peak of 3500 in June. Thereafter, the number of cases dropped slowly to about 2800 in August, before levelling off at 2500 for the rest of the year. For males, the figures were lower but showed a similar trend throughout the epidemic.

>
> The graph shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 users, for selected countries. Overall, most of the countries included in the graph have more mobile phones subscribers than landlines.
>
> Most European countries have high mobile phone use. The biggest users of mobile phones are the Italians, with 88 cell phones per 100 people. For example, Italy has twice as many mobile phones as landlines, with 88 mobiles per hundred people compared to 45 for landlines. Mobile phone use is low in Canada, with fewer than 40 phones per 100 people. Denmark is also unusual because it has slightly more landlines than mobile phones.
>
> However, in some countries, the number of landlines is higher than the number of mobile phones. One example is the USA, where the number of mobiles, at 50 per 100 people, is much lower than the number of landlines, at almost 70 per hundred. A similar pattern can be seen in Canada. The highest number of landlines in the graph is in Denmark, with about 90 per 100 people. In contrast, the lowest figures for fixed lines are in Italy and the UK.
>
> In conclusion, it seems that mobile phone use is higher in Europe than in North America.

> The table shows that the figures for imprisonment in the five countries mentioned indicate no overall pattern of increase or decrease. In fact there is considerable fluctuation from country to country.
>
> In Great Britain the numbers in prison have increased steadily from 30 000 in 1930 to 80,000 in 1980. On the other hand in Australia, and particularly in New Zealand the numbers fell markedly from 1930 to 1940. Since then they have increased gradually, apart from in 1980 when the numbers in prison in New Zealand fell by about 30,000 from the 1970 total. Canada is the only country in which the numbers in prison have decreased over the period 1930 to 1980, although there have been fluctuations in this trend. The figures for the United States indicate the greatest number of prisoners compared to the other four countries but population size needs to be taken into account in this analysis. The prison population in the United States increased rapidly from 1970 to 1980 and this must be a worrying trend.

>
> The most obvious trend in the graph is that women have lower employment rates in most of the countries in the graph. For example, in Australia in 1995, 57 percent of men could find work or retain a job, but only 27 percent of women. The difference was even bigger in New Zealand, with 60 percent of women. Even in Switzerland and Iceland, alightly more men than women were in the job market.
>
> The second biggest trend in the graph is the improvement in employment between 1995 and 2005. In all countries shown, figures for both men and women improved. The biggest change was in the United Kingdom, from 55 percent of men in 1995 to 73 percent over the ten years period.
>
> Furthermore, the increases in employment rates for women were much higher in New Zealand. The percentage of working women jumped from 25 percent to 42 percent, and in the United States from 45 percent to 61 percent over the decade.
>
> In conclusion, all the countries in the graph showed at least a 12 percent increase in employment rates of both men and women over the ten yeares. While men had relatively higher employment rate throughout the period, more and more women appear to be entering the labour market.

> The most significant feature is that oil production will increase sharply in almost all the countries shown. Kuwait and Iraq are both expected to double their output between 1990 and 2010, with Kuwait's production rising from 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 1990 to 3.8 in 2010. Iran will also increase its output by a slightly smaller amount. After remaining steady at 2.5 million bpd from 1990 to 2000, the UAE's output is expected to approach 4.0 million bpd in 2010. Only Qatar's production is predicted to fall, back to 0.8 million bpd after a slight rise in 2000.
>
> However, the greatest increase will be from Saudi Arabia. In 1990, its output capacity at 8.5 million bpd exceeded the combined production of Iran, Iraq and Kuwait. This lead is expected to continue with a 75% increase in production to 14.5 million bpd 2010.

> The graph shows changes in the amount of fast food consumed in the UK between 1970 and 1990. Several trends are apparent. First, Britons are eating more and more fast food. Secondly, the type of fast food has changed.
>
> In 1970, the most popular fast food was fish and chips. Over 300g were consumed each week. By 1990, however, this had fallen to just over 200g - a 50% drop. Consumption of other fast foods such as pizza and hamburgers increased, however. The amount of pizza eaten shot up from about 20g a week to more than 270g, overtaking fish and chips in the late 1980s. Hamburger consumption also increased, rising from about 80g in 1970 to almost 300g in 1990.
>
> Accompanying this change in the choice of foods was an increase in the amount of fast food consumed. In 1970, British consumers ate about 450g a week of fast food. In 1990, on the other hand, this had more than doubled, to 1000g.
>
> *alternative answer:*
>
> The graph shows the amount of fast food eaten between 1970 and 1990 in grams per person per week. Overall, the amount of fast food eaten more than doubled.

>
> In contrast, sales of hamburger and pizza rocketed. In 1970, very little pizza was eaten - less than 50g/week. This rose to 280g/week by 1990. In the same period, hamburger sales shot up by more than 500%, from 100g/week in 1970 to 500 grams in 1990.

> The graph shows weekly expenditure on fast food in Britain by food and income group. There are two main trends. First, the expenditure is directly related to income. Secondly, there are differences in the types of fast food eaten by each group.
>
> The amount of money spent on fast food is related to income. People in the high-income group spent the most - over 85 pence per person per week. People in the low-income group spent the least - less than half of what the high-income earners spent.
>
> The type of fast food eaten also depends on the group. High-income earners spent 3 times more on hamburgers than people in the low-income group. Pizza was generally the least favorite food. Fish and chips was the most popular food with the low-income group but consumption was fairly similar among all groups.

> The graphs show health and education spending and changes in life expectancy and infant mortality in the UAE. Overall, as the percentage spent on health and education increases, infant mortality and life expectancy improve.
>
> Graph 1 shows the percentage of GDP spent on health and education between 1985 and 1993. There were big increases in both areas. Health spending stood at about 8% in 1985 but rose to 9% in 1990 and 10% in 1993. Spending on education was even higher. It was 10% in 1985, and shot up to 14% in 1990 and 15% in 1993, a 50% increase in just 8 years.
>
> Graph 2 shows improvements in life expectancy and infant mortality between 1970 and 1992. Life expectancy was just 60 in 1970 but rose to almost 72 in 1992. In contrast, the number of babies dying dropped dramatically, from 60 per 1000 in 1970 to only 22 in 1992.

>
> 60\. In contrast, countries such as Egypt, Morocco and Syria have less than 20 computers per 1000 inhabitants.
>
> There are also great differences in Internet use and availability. The UAE has by far the highest proportion of users, with more than one-third of its population using the Internet. Kuwait and Lebanon are second and third again, with 100 users per thousand in Kuwait and 80 in Lebanon. In some countries the number using the Internet is negligible: Saudi Arabia has less than 20 users per thousand, and there are fewer than 5 users per thousand in Syria.
>
> One unusual feature of the graph is that Internet use does not seem to be directly related to the number of computers. In several countries (the UAE, Lebanon, Jordan and Oman), there are more Internet users per thousand people than computers. However, in other countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria, the number of Internet users is lower than the number of computers.
>
> In summary, there are major differences between computer use and Internet use in the Arab world, but the UAE clearly leads the area in both number of computers and number of internet users per capita.

> The table shows how people in different age groups spend their leisure time in Someland over the course of a year. It can be clearly seen that the amount of leisure time available varies considerably across the age groups and that people of different age levels have very different ways of spending their leisure time.
>
> According to the figures, as people age in Someland their social lives reduce. Teenagers and people in their twenties spend on average 500 hours per year on socialising and 350 hours of that time is with a group of more than 4 people. Although the total hours of socialising in their 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s is fairly constant (between 300-350), socialising with more than 4 people drops dramatically to 50 hours in the 30s and 40s age groups and only 25 from 50 years old. Group and individual exercise follow a similar pattern.
>
> People of all ages spend a good part of their leisure time on entertainment such as TV/video viewing and cinema. In both cases, teenagers and retired people spend around twice as much time as those who are at working age. Home entertainment ranges from just over a thousand hours for teenagers and retired people and an average of 600 hours for everyone else. Cinema accounts for 100 hours of the teenagers and retired people’s leisure time and 25-50 hours for the rest.
>
> In conclusion we can see there is a significant trend towards solitary and smaller group activities as people grow older and that teenagers and retired people spend a lot more time on entertainment than those of working age do.

>
> In 1945 only 30% of women completed their secondary education and 1% went on to a first degree. No women had completed post-graduate studies. This situation had changed radically by 1995. In 1995, 90% of women in Someland had completed secondary education and of those, half had graduated from an initial degree and 20% had gone on to postgraduate studies. At the other end of the scale we can see that by 1995 all girls were completing lower secondary, although 10% ended their schooling at this point. This is in stark contrast with 1945 when only 30% of girls completed primary school, 35% had no schooling at all and 35% only completed the third grade.
>
> In conclusion, we can see that in the 50 years from 1945 to 1995 there have been huge positive developments to the education levels of women in Someland.

It can be clearly seen that the amount of research funding in many cases did not correlate with the seriousness of the disease in terms of numbers of deaths.
>
> In 1990 there were around 0.2 million deaths from AIDS, 0.1 million deaths from leprosy, 0.3 million deaths from tropical diseases, 0.5 million deaths from diarrhoea, 0.4 million deaths from malaria and 1.8 million deaths from TB. These figures can be contrasted with the amount of funding allocated for each disease. In 1990 AIDS received 180 million dollars in research funding, leprosy 80 million dollars in research funding, tropical diseases 79 million dollars in research funding, diarrhoea 60 million dollars in research funding, malaria 50 million dollars and TB 20 million dollars in research funding.

>
> In 1960, 600 men in every 1,000 was smoking. This number decreased gradually to 500 by 1974 and continued to decrease but more steeply to 250 in 2000. In contrast, the rate of smoking in women in 1960 was very low at only 80 in every 1,000. By 1968 this increased to 170, and increased again but more steeply to 320 in 1977. The rate of female smokers then remained stable at 320 until 1984 at which point the figures began to decline and had dropped to 200 by 2000.
>
> In conclusion we can see that the rate of smoking in men dropped throughout the whole period but was always at a higher level than the female figures. The rate of smoking in women increased until 1977 but then decreased for the rest of the period.

> Among those employed full-time, men on average had fifty hours of leisure, whereas women had approximately thirty-seven hours. There were no figures given for male part-time workers, but female part-timers had forty hours of leisure time, only slightly more than women in full-time employment, perhaps reflecting their work in the home.
>
> In the unemployed and retired categories, leisure time showed an increase for both sexes, as might have been expected. Here too, men enjoyed more leisure time over eighty hours, compared with seventy hours for women, perhaps once again reflecting the fact that women spend more time working in the home than men.
>
> Lastly, housewives enjoyed approximately fifty-four hours of leisure, on average. There were no figures given for househusbands! Overall, the chart demonstrates that in the categories for which statistics on male leisure time were available, men enjoyed at least ten hours of extra leisure time.

> *model answer:*
>
> Differences in sleep patterns appear to reflect differences in individuals' occupations.
>
> A Canadian study has pointed out, for example, that students typically sleep for a consecutive 8- hour period each night, from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. This may be because the central activity in their lives, study, takes place in normal daylight hours. Similarly, business executives sleep consecutive hours, but perhaps because their jobs are especially busy and stressful they sleep for 6 hours on average, getting up around 5 a.m..
>
> By contrast, truck drivers, probably because of their need to keep their trucks on the road over long periods, tend to sleep in two 3-hour blocks: one between 7 and 10 a.m. and another from 4 to 7 p.m. Another occupation associated with broken sleep schedules is that of doctors. They tend to retire to bed around 1 a.m. and start their day at 7 a.m.., but may be woken up to deal with emergencies in the middle of the night. Finally, full-time mothers, especially those with young children, tend to sleep when their babies do. Typically, they will sleep from 10 p.m. and be awoken at 1 a.m. to comfort their babies for a couple of hours. They then go back to bed to wake at 6 a.m., but nap for two hours or so in the early afternoon.
>
> Thus the influence on one's sleep pattern is worthy of consideration when choosing an occupation.

> The diagram reveals that the number of hours per week spent in unpaid work is unequally distributed between men and women.
>
> In households where there are no children, women are reported to work some 30 hours per week in such tasks as housework and gardening. Men's contribution to these unpaid jobs averages a considerably lower 18 hours.
>
> When children enter the household, however, the inequality becomes even more pronounced. In families of 1 - 2 children, men maintain approximately the same number of hours of unpaid work as in childless households, but the number of hours women work in the home rises to 52 per week, much of it, on doubt, due to childcare responsibilities.
>
> Interestingly, when there are three or more children in the household, men are found to work even fewer hours around the house than before the appearance of the third child. Whereas women's unpaid hours rise to approximately 56 per week, the corresponding figure for men, 16, actually represents a decrease.

> The table shows that Japan and Canada had annual incomes of \$15 760 and \$11 100 per person, respectively. These figures were overwhelmingly greater than the corresponding figures of \$160 in Peru and \$130 in Zaire.
>
> Health indicators, too, reflected overall levels of affluence in the four nations. Life expectancy at birth, for example, was higher among the more economically developed countries. Japan reported the highest life expectancy, 78. This was followed by Canada, 76; Peru, 51; and Zaire, 47; This suggests that richer societies are able to put more money into health care than poorer ones.
>
> The amount of calories consumed daily per person roughly followed the same ranking. Canadians each consumed some 3 326 calories per day while the Japanese took 2846 calories. The corresponding figures for Peru and Zaire were 1927 and 1749, respectively.
>
> Literacy rates among adults, too, were higher in wealthier countries, no doubt a reflection of ability to invest in education. Canada and Japan both reported literacy rates of 99%, while Peru claimed 68%. Zaire, the least economically developed of the four countries, had a literacy rate of 34%.

> *model answer:*
>
> Most consumer goods go through a series of stages before they emerge as finished products ready for sale.
>
> Raw materials and manufactured components comprise the initial physical input in the manufacturing process. Once obtained, these are stored for later assembly. But assembly first depends upon the production planning stage, where it is decided how and in what quantities the stored materials will be processed to create sufficient quantities of finished goods. The production planning stage itself follows the requirements of the goods' design stage that proceeds from extensive research. After assembly, the products are inspected and tested to maintain quality control l Those units that pass the inspection and testing stages are then packaged, despatched and offered for sale in retail outlets. The level of sales, which is the end point of the manufacturing process, helps determine production planning.
>
> A product's design is not only the result of product research, but is also influenced by testing and market research. If the testing stage (after assembly and inspection) reveals unacceptable problems in the finished product, then adjustments will have to be made to the product's design. Similarly, market research, which examines the extent and nature of the demand for products, has the role of guiding product design to suit consumer demands which may change with time.
>
> Market research, while influenced by product sales, also serves to foster future sales by devising suitable advertising for the goods.
>
> Thus the reality of consumer goods manufacturing goes well beyond a simple linear production process.

> Anyone who has visited a dentist has been told that eating excessive amounts of sweets risks harming the teeth. This is because sweets lower pH levels in the mouth to dangerous levels.
>
> When the pH level in the mouth is kept above 5.5, acidity is such that teeth are unlikely to be in danger of decay. Sweet foods, however, cause pH in the mouth to drop for a time, and the longer pH levels remain below 5.5, the greater the opportunity for decay to occur.
>
> By comparing fruit sugar, cane sugar and honey, which are all common ingredients of sweet foods, we find that cane sugar lowers pH levels for the longest period, thus producing the greatest risk of the three. Approximately five minutes aftfter consuming cane sugar, pH levels drop to as little as pH 3.5. They then begin to rise slowly, but do not rise above pH 5.5 until at least 30 minutes have elapsed. By contrast, fruit sugar, which causes the mouth's acidity to fall to just above pH 4, poses a danger for a shorter period: tooth decay is unlikely 20 minutes after consumption. Honey appears an even less risky substance. Though acidity falls to about pH 4.75 within five minutes of consumption, it returns to above pH 5.5 in under fifteen minutes.
>
> The implications, then, are that people who insist on eating sweet foods should be aware of the ingredients, and that fruit sugar or honey appear preferable to cane sugar.

>
> A similar situation was seen in the wholesale and retail trade sector, where the number of women rose from about 550 000 in 1975 to almost 800 000 two decades later. The number of men in this sector remained stable over the period, at around 700 000.
>
> Women also made gains in both the finance/banking industries and in the defence-related public sector. Whereas some 125 000 women worked in finance and banking institutions in 1975, the number increased to 450 000 by 1995. The number of men grew only marginally from 425 000 to 480 000 over the same period. In defence, the number of men declined from 225 000 to 200 000, while the number of women rose from 25 000 to over 100 000.

The second largest consumer was Latin America. Europe and Asia purchased 20.5 and 16.4 per cent of the total volume respectively, while Africa and the Middle East remained fairly small consumers at 7 per cent of the total volume of sales.

> Since 1996, share prices for Coca-Cola have fluctuated. In that year, shares were valued at approximately \$35. Between 1996 and 1997, however, prices rose significantly to \$70 per share. They dipped a little in mid-1997 and then peaked at \$80 per share in mid-98. From then until 2000 their value fell consistently but there was a slight rise in mid-2000.
