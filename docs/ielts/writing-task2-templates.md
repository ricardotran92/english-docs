**Body Paragraph 1 — View 1**  
On the one hand, there are several reasons why `<group 1>` choose to `<describe view 1>`.
Firstly, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This `<verb: allows/enables/provides>` them to `<result or outcome>`.
Secondly, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific example>`.
As a result, `<positive outcome summarizing this viewpoint>`.

On the other hand, there are convincing reasons why `<group 2>` prefer to `<describe view 2>`.
To begin with, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This enables them to `<benefit or result>`.
Moreover, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific scenario/example>`.
Therefore, `<why this view is appealing or more practical>`.

**Body Paragraph 3 — Your Opinion / Synthesis (optional but band-boosting)**  
In my opinion, both sides have merit, but `<your stance>` is more (practical or) beneficial in the modern context.
This is because `<reason/explanation>`.
Ideally, combining the strengths of both perspectives, such as `<example of balance>`, which could yield the most (desirable) outcome.

**Introduction**

People hold differing opinions about whether `<clause/phrase: restate topic>`.

**Body Paragraph 1 — Opposing View (Brief & Neutral)**

On the one hand, there are several reasons why `<n-phrase: group 1 (e.g., some people/supporters/advocates)>` support `<clause/phrase: describe opposing view>`.
Firstly, `<clause: reason 1 with explanation>`. This allows/enables/provides them to `<v-phrase: result or benefit>`.
Secondly, `<clause: reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific example or situation>`.
However, this argument may not hold true in all situations, as it overlooks `<n-phrase/clause: main limitation or contrast to your stance>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 — Your View (Main Argument)**

On the other hand, I strongly agree that `<clause/phrase: your main stance>`.
To begin with, `<clause: reason 1 with explanation>`. This enables individuals to `<v-phrase: benefit/result>` and better adapt to `<n-phrase: context>`.
Moreover, `<clause: reason 2 with explanation>`. For example, `<specific scenario/example>` clearly introduces/demonstrates how `<clause/phrase: your point is more practical or future-oriented>`.
Therefore, `<clause/phrase: why your stance leads to more sustainable or realistic outcomes>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 — Opinion Justification / Reinforcement (Optional but Band-boosting)**

In my opinion, `<clause/phrase: your stance>` clearly outweighs the opposing argument.
This is because `<clause: key justification or evidence>`.
Furthermore, `<clause/phrase: reason 2 or consequence>`, which shows why this approach brings long-term advantages.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, although `<clause/phrase: summarize opposing view>` provides `<n-phrase: minor benefit>`, `<clause/phrase: your stance>` brings far greater advantages in terms of `<n-phrase: key benefit or impact>`.
Thus/Hence, I firmly believe that `<clause: restate your view>` is/represents the most practical and beneficial choice/direction in the modern era.
This is because it `<clause/phrase: final justification or summary reason>`.

## 3️⃣🔹 **Universal Band 9 Template (Advantages & Disadvantages – Outweigh Type)**

---

### **Introduction**

People hold differing opinions about whether `<restate topic>`.
Although this development/topic/issue may introduce certain drawbacks such as `<n-phrase/gerund: main disadvantage>`, I firmly believe that its advantages—particularly `<clause/phrase: main advantage>`—far outweigh these disadvantages in the modern context.

---

### **Body Paragraph 1 — Advantages (Main Argument)**

On the one hand, there are numerous/remarkable advantages resulting from `<phrase/gerund: topic>`.
Firstly, `<clause: advantage 1 with explanation>`. This allows/enables/helps individuals or society to `<v-phrase: positive outcome>`.
Secondly, `<clause: advantage 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific scenario or evidence>` clearly introduces/demonstrates how `<n/v-phrase: positive consequence>`.
Therefore, `<n-phrase: topic>` plays a crucial role in promoting `<n-phrase: broader benefit or progress>` and fostering/contributing positively to `<n-phrase: long-term impact>`.

---

### **Body Paragraph 2 — Disadvantages (Brief & Balanced)**

On the other hand, several drawbacks associated with `<n-phrase: topic>` should not be overlooked.
To begin with, `<clause: disadvantage 1 with explanation>`. This may result in (/lead to) `<n-phrase: negative impact or challenge>`.
Moreover, `<clause: disadvantage 2 with explanation>`. For example, `<relevant example>` illustrates/shows that `<clause: negative effect>`.
[Optional] However, these issues are relatively minor and can be effectively mitigated through `<n-phrase: possible solution or policy>`, making the drawbacks/disadvantages far less significant compared to (/than) the advantages discussed above.

---

### **Body Paragraph 3 — Why Advantages Outweigh Disadvantages (Optional – Band-boosting)**

In my opinion, the advantages/benefits of `<phrase/gerund: topic>` clearly outweigh the disadvantages/drawbacks.
This is because `<clause: key justification or evidence showing long-term value>`.
Furthermore, `<clause: additional reason or consequence>`, which proves that focusing on `<n-phrase/gerund: advantage>` is a more realistic and sustainable approach.
Ideally, while some limitations remain, the overall positive impact of `<n-phrase: topic>` is undeniable in today’s world.

---

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, although `<n-phrase/gerund: summarize main disadvantage>` may cause/pose certain challenges, the advantages of `<n-phrase: topic>`—such as `<n-phrase: key benefits>`—are far greater in both scope and significance.
Thus/Hence, I firmly/strongly believe that `<clause: restate your position>` is/represents the most practical and beneficial choice/direction in the modern era.
