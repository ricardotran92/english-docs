## 2️⃣ DISCUSSION ESSAY (Both Views + Opinion)

---

### 🔹 Universal Band 9 Template

**Introduction**  
People hold differing opinions about whether `<restate topic>`.
While `<paraphrase View 1>` may offer `<main advantage>`, others argue that `<paraphrase View 2>` provides `<main benefit>`.
In my view, both perspectives have valid points, yet the effectiveness of each largely depends on `<context/condition>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 — View 1**  
On the one hand, there are several reasons why `<group 1>` choose to `<describe view 1>`.
Firstly, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This allows them to `<result or outcome>`.
Secondly, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific example>`.
As a result, `<positive outcome summarizing this viewpoint>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 — View 2**  
On the other hand, those who support `<view 2>` argue that `<main argument>`.
When people `<describe action>`, they can `<benefit, advantage or result>`.
Moreover, `<reason 2>`. For instance, `<specific scenario>`.
Therefore, `<why this view is appealing or more practical>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 — Your Opinion / Synthesis (optional but band-boosting)**  
In my opinion, both sides have merit, but `<your stance>` is more (practical or) beneficial in the modern context.
This is because `<reason/explanation>`.
Ideally, combining the strengths of both perspectives — such as `<example of balance>` — could yield the most (desirable) outcome.

---

**Conclusion**  
In conclusion, although `<summarize view 1>` offers `<benefit>`, `<summarize view 2>` leads to `<benefit>`.
Therefore, the most appropriate choice depends on `<your final justification>`.
Nevertheless, a balanced approach that embraces elements of both sides can bring long-term success or sustainability.

#### 🏁 **INTRODUCTION**

```csharp
[Sentence 1] Introduce the topic generally
    → "People hold differing opinions about whether <restate topic in general terms>."

[2] Introduce the two sides
    → "While <paraphrase View 1> may offer <main advantage>, others argue that <paraphrase View 2> provides <main benefit>."

    ├ "While some people argue that <paraphrase View 1> offers <main benefit>, others believe that <paraphrase View 2> provides <key advantage>."

[3] State your overall opinion

    IF opinion == balanced:
        → "In my view, both perspectives have valid points, yet the effectiveness of each largely depends on <context/condition>."
    ELSE IF opinion == one_side_view1:
        → "Personally, I side with the idea that <view 1> is more beneficial because <reason>."
    ELSE:
        → "From my perspective, <view 2> offers greater <benefit> and aligns better with <modern/contextual factor>."

#### 🧱 **BODY PARAGRAPH 1 — View 1**

    ├ "On the one hand, supporters of <view 1> believe that <main argument>."

[2–3] Explain Reason 1
    → "Firstly, <reason 1>. This allows them to <result/outcome>."

[4–5] Add Reason 2 + Example
    → "Secondly, <reason 2>. For example, <specific illustration>."
    ├ "Secondly, <reason 2>. For instance, <specific example>."
    ├ "As individuals continue to <action>, they tend to <result>. For example, <specific illustration: person/company/situation> demonstrates how <evidence>."

[6] Summarize benefit of View 1
    → "As a result, <positive outcome summarizing this viewpoint>."
    ├ "Therefore, it is understandable why many people consider <view 1> as <positive attribute>."

IF (this view is weak or unrealistic):
    - Viết ngắn hơn (chỉ 3 câu)
    - Kết thúc bằng câu chuyển tiếp:
      → "However, this argument may not hold true in all situations."

    [2–3] Explain why your stance outweighs others

### 🧠 **Quick logic recap (pseudo-code logic)**

```plaintext
START
  INTRO: Introduce topic → contrast views → state opinion
  BODY1: Explain View1 → reasons → example → mini-summary
  BODY2: Explain View2 → reasons → example → mini-summary
  IF (task requires opinion):
      BODY3: Personal stance → justification → optional synthesis or justify view 1/2
  ENDIF
  CONCLUSION: Summarize both → reaffirm opinion → optional balance
END
```
