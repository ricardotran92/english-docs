### üîπ Universal Band 9 Template (Balance)

**Introduction**  
People hold differing opinions about whether `<restate topic>`.
While `<paraphrase View 1>` may offer `<main advantage>`, others argue that `<paraphrase View 2>` provides `<main benefit>`.
In my view, both perspectives have valid points, yet the effectiveness of each largely depends on `<context/condition>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî View 1**  
On the one hand, there are several reasons why `<group 1>` choose to `<describe view 1>`.
Firstly, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This `<verb: allows/enables/provides>` them to `<result or outcome>`.
Secondly, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific example>`.
As a result, `<positive outcome summarizing this viewpoint>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî View 2**  
On the other hand, there are convincing reasons why `<group 2>` prefer to `<describe view 2>`.
To begin with, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This enables them to `<benefit or result>`.
Moreover, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific scenario/example>`.
Therefore, `<why this view is appealing or more practical>`.


---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Your Opinion / Synthesis (optional but band-boosting)**  
In my opinion, both sides have merit, but `<your stance>` is more (practical or) beneficial in the modern context.
This is because `<reason/explanation>`.
Ideally, combining the strengths of both perspectives, such as `<example of balance>`, which could yield the most (desirable) outcome.

---

**Conclusion**  
In conclusion, although `<summarize view 1>` offers `<benefit>`, `<summarize view 2>` leads to `<benefit>`.
Therefore, the most appropriate choice depends on `<your final justification>`.
Nevertheless, a balanced approach that embraces elements of both sides can bring long-term success or sustainability.


### üîπ Universal Band 9 Template (One-Side)

**Introduction**

People hold differing opinions about whether `<restate topic>`.
While `<paraphrase opposing view>` may offer `<its main advantage>`, I firmly believe that `<your view>` is more `<beneficial/practical>` in the modern context because `<reason>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî Opposing View (Brief & Neutral)**

On the one hand, there are several reasons why `<group 1>` support `<describe opposing view>`.
Firstly, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This `<verb: allows/enables/provides>` them to `<result or benefit>`.
Secondly, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For instance, `<specific example or situation>`.
However, this argument may not hold true in all situations, as it overlooks `<main limitation or contrast to your stance>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî Your View (Main Argument)**

On the other hand, I strongly agree that `<your main stance>`.
To begin with, `<reason 1 with explanation>`. This enables individuals to `<benefit/result>` and better adapt to `<context>`.
Moreover, `<reason 2 with explanation>`. For example, `<specific scenario/example>` demonstrates how `<your point is more practical or future-oriented>`.
Therefore, `<why your stance leads to more sustainable or realistic outcomes>`.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Opinion Justification / Reinforcement (Optional but Band-boosting)**

In my opinion, `<your stance>` clearly outweighs the opposing argument.
This is because `<key justification or evidence>`.
Furthermore, `<reason 2 or consequence>`, which shows why this approach brings long-term advantages.
Ideally, while the opposing view has some merit, focusing on `<your stance>` remains the most realistic and sustainable approach in today‚Äôs world.

---

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, although `<summarize opposing view>` provides `<minor benefit>`, `<your stance>` brings far greater advantages in terms of `<key benefit or impact>`.
Thus, I firmly believe that `<restate your view>` is the most practical and beneficial choice in the modern era.
This is because it `<final justification or summary reason>`.

    ‚îú "While some people argue that <paraphrase View 1> offers <main benefit>, others believe that <paraphrase View 2> provides <key advantage>."

[3] State your overall opinion

    IF opinion == balanced:

[2‚Äì3] Explain Reason 1
    ‚Üí "Firstly, <reason 1>. This allows them to <result/outcome>."
