### üß© **Sample 1 ‚Äî Balanced View**

#### **Topic:**

> Some people think that it is better to work for the same company throughout their career, while others believe that changing companies brings more benefits.
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

#### **Band 9 Model Answer (Balanced View)**

**Introduction**
People hold differing opinions about whether employees should stay in the same organization for their entire career or move between different ones.
While long-term employment may offer stability and deep expertise, others argue that switching companies provides greater opportunities for growth and adaptability.
In my view, both perspectives have valid points, yet the effectiveness of each largely depends on individual career goals and industry trends.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî View 1**
On the one hand, there are several reasons why many workers choose to remain in one company.
Firstly, it allows individuals to gain in-depth knowledge of the organization‚Äôs culture, structure, and workflow. This enables them to build strong internal networks and often leads to increased trust from management, which enhances their promotion prospects.
Secondly, long-term employment provides job security and emotional stability. For instance, many Vietnamese firms value loyalty and reward long-serving employees with lifetime contracts and retirement benefits.
As a result, staying with one company can create a sense of belonging and long-term satisfaction.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî View 2**
On the other hand, there are convincing reasons why many employees prefer to change companies periodically.
To begin with, moving between organizations helps them acquire diverse skills and adapt to different working cultures. This enables them to broaden their professional networks and accelerate career advancement.
Moreover, frequent transitions often lead to higher salaries and greater job satisfaction. For instance, many IT professionals in major Vietnamese cities such as Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi often change jobs every few years to pursue new technologies and negotiate better salaries.
Therefore, career mobility is often regarded as an effective strategy to remain competitive in today‚Äôs rapidly evolving job market.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Opinion / Synthesis**
In my opinion, both sides have merit, but a balanced approach is most practical.
This is because staying too long in one company can lead to stagnation, whereas moving too frequently might prevent deep skill development.
Ideally, individuals should remain in a company long enough to master their role, such as staying for several years to build expertise, which would then allow them to seek new challenges elsewhere to expand their horizons.

---

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, although long-term employment ensures stability and loyalty, career mobility allows professionals to gain diverse experiences and better opportunities.
Therefore, the optimal choice depends on personal ambition and the nature of one‚Äôs industry.
Nevertheless, combining both approaches ‚Äî stability in the early stages and flexibility later ‚Äî can lead to sustainable career success.

### üß© **Sample 2 ‚Äî One-Sided View**

#### **Topic:**

> Some people believe that students should focus only on academic subjects, while others think extracurricular activities are equally important.
> Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

---

#### **Band 9 Model Answer (One-Sided Opinion)**

**Introduction**
People hold differing opinions about whether students should focus solely on academic subjects or also participate in extracurricular activities.
While concentrating on academics may offer higher exam performance and clearer routes to top universities, I firmly believe that participating in extracurricular activities is more beneficial in the modern context because it cultivates essential soft skills and emotional resilience.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî View 1**
On the one hand, there are several reasons why some people support focusing solely on academic subjects.
Firstly, dedicating full attention to academic study enables students to master key disciplines such as mathematics, science and languages. This enables them to achieve higher grades and secure places at prestigious universities.
Secondly, strong academic records often attract scholarships and better career prospects. For instance, students who excel in STEM subjects frequently receive offers from leading institutions.
However, this argument may not hold true in all situations, as it overlooks the importance of interpersonal skills and practical experience required in many modern workplaces.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî View 2 (your side)**
On the other hand, I strongly agree that extracurricular activities should be integrated with academic study.
To begin with, participating in sports, arts or volunteer work helps learners develop teamwork, leadership and communication skills. This enables individuals to become more adaptable and confident when facing real-world challenges.
Moreover, involvement in extracurricular programmes reduces academic stress and nurtures creativity. For instance, students who join debate or music clubs often demonstrate superior communication abilities and perform better in interviews.
Therefore, integrating extracurricular activities with academic study better prepares young people for both employment and social participation.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Opinion Justification (One-Sided)**
In my opinion, integrating extracurricular activities with academic study clearly outweighs the opposing argument.
This is because employers increasingly seek candidates with both technical knowledge and interpersonal skills.
Furthermore, combining academic learning with extracurricular engagement improves employability and encourages lifelong learning, which shows why this approach brings long-term advantages.
Ideally, while the opposing view has some merit, focusing on integrating extracurricular activities with academics remains the most realistic and sustainable approach in today‚Äôs world.

---

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, although focusing solely on academic subjects provides strong academic foundations, integrating extracurricular activities leads to more holistic development.
Thus, I firmly believe that combining academic study with extracurricular participation is the most practical and beneficial choice in the modern era.
This is because it equips students with both technical competence and essential interpersonal skills needed for future success.
