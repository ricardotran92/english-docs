### üß© **Sample 1 ‚Äî Balanced View**

#### **Topic:**

> Some people think that it is better to work for the same company throughout their career, while others believe that changing companies brings more benefits.
> Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

#### **Band 9 Model Answer (Balanced View)**

**Introduction**
People hold differing opinions about whether employees should stay in the same organization for their entire career or move between different ones.
While long-term employment may offer stability and deep expertise, others argue that switching companies provides greater opportunities for growth and adaptability.
In my view, both perspectives have valid points, yet the effectiveness of each largely depends on individual career goals and industry trends.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî View 1**
On the one hand, remaining in one company can be highly advantageous for many workers.
Firstly, it allows individuals to gain in-depth knowledge of the organization‚Äôs culture, structure, and workflow. This often leads to increased trust from management and higher chances of promotion.
Secondly, long-term employment provides job security and emotional stability. For example, many Japanese firms value loyalty and reward long-serving employees with lifetime contracts and retirement benefits.
As a result, staying with one company can create a sense of belonging and long-term satisfaction.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî View 2**
On the other hand, changing companies periodically can offer wider experiences and faster career advancement.
When professionals move between organizations, they can acquire new skills, broaden their networks, and adapt to different working environments.
Moreover, frequent transitions often lead to higher salaries and better career prospects. For instance, many tech workers in Silicon Valley switch jobs every few years to take on new challenges and negotiate better compensation.
Therefore, career mobility is often viewed as a way to remain competitive in today‚Äôs rapidly evolving job market.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Opinion / Synthesis**
In my opinion, both sides have merit, but a balanced approach is most practical.
This is because staying too long in one company can lead to stagnation, whereas moving too frequently might prevent deep skill development.
Ideally, individuals should remain in a company long enough to master their role, and then seek new challenges elsewhere to expand their horizons.

---

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, although long-term employment ensures stability and loyalty, career mobility allows professionals to gain diverse experiences and better opportunities.
Therefore, the optimal choice depends on personal ambition and the nature of one‚Äôs industry.
Nevertheless, combining both approaches ‚Äî stability in the early stages and flexibility later ‚Äî can lead to sustainable career success.

### üß© **Sample 2 ‚Äî One-Sided View**

#### **Topic:**

> Some people believe that students should focus only on academic subjects, while others think extracurricular activities are equally important.
> Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

---

#### **Band 9 Model Answer (One-Sided Opinion)**

**Introduction**
People hold contrasting opinions about whether students should dedicate all their time to academic subjects or also engage in extracurricular activities.
While prioritizing academics may improve academic performance, I firmly believe that extracurricular participation plays a crucial role in fostering well-rounded personal development.

---

**Body Paragraph 1 ‚Äî View 1**
On the one hand, focusing solely on academic subjects can be beneficial for students who aim to excel in their studies.
Firstly, it enables them to allocate maximum time and concentration to core disciplines such as mathematics, science, and languages, which are often decisive in university admissions.
Secondly, academic excellence opens doors to scholarships and better career opportunities. For example, top-performing students in STEM fields often secure prestigious university placements.
Therefore, it is understandable why some people advocate a purely academic focus.

---

**Body Paragraph 2 ‚Äî View 2 (your side)**
On the other hand, extracurricular activities are equally essential in modern education.
When students participate in sports, arts, or volunteer work, they develop vital life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and emotional resilience.
Moreover, such activities enhance creativity and relieve academic stress. For instance, students involved in debate clubs often perform better in communication-based subjects and interviews.
Thus, extracurricular engagement nurtures both mental and emotional intelligence, preparing students for real-world challenges.

---

**Body Paragraph 3 ‚Äî Opinion Justification (One-Sided)**
Personally, I am more convinced by the argument that extracurricular activities should be integrated with academics.
This approach not only supports intellectual growth but also builds character and social awareness.
For example, educational systems in Finland emphasize balanced development and consistently rank among the world‚Äôs best.
Therefore, focusing exclusively on academics is unrealistic in a world that values collaboration and creativity as much as technical knowledge.

---

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, while a strong academic foundation is essential, incorporating extracurricular activities ensures students‚Äô holistic development.
Hence, I strongly believe that schools should strike a balance between study and play to produce competent and adaptable future citizens.

Would you like me to create a **third essay** showing a *‚Äúneutral structure but leaning slightly to one side‚Äù* (a hybrid Band 9 style that examiners love because it reads ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù but still shows a clear opinion)?
